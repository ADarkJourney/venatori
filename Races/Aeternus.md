# The Aeternus
_(from latin for etnernal: aeternus)_
A race of immortal beings - or seemingly so - they do not age, nor do they die from sickness or disease - but they can be killed.  They are the overlords to most of the worlds supernatural beings.  Because of their long life Aeternus control their population - one full blooded child per couple per 100 years.

An Aeternus stops aging upon completing the Ad Aetatem (coming of age) ritual, which is usually held around a quarter of a century old.

## Clans

There are several clans of Aeternus per region.  Most intermingle marriages in order to disperse genetic material.  There are four predominate clans.

1. Dragon Clan - A predominately Asian clan, but there are a few regions in the US that the dragon clan claim residence.  Their tribal tattoo is of a dragon's fang.
2. Shadow Clan - A unique clan that keeps to themselves and typically are found in the middle of all other clans, they tend to be solitary souls.  Their tribal symbol is a waning cresent moon.
3. Eagle Clan - Predominately found in North America reagion. Their tribal tattoo is an eagle in flight.
4. Nomad Clan - The Nomad clans are found regionally everywhere in the world, each culture tends to vary, unlike the other clans, which is pretty set in stone. Their tribal tattoo is the English letter N.
 
However there are two organizations that override any clan allegeinces - the Scrin and the Venatori.  You forgo your prior clan if you are part of either of these organizations.  The tribal symbol for the Venatori is a sword, and the tribal symbol of the Scrin is a solid vertical line representing the spine of a book.

## Ad Aetatem
A ritual preformed as an Aeternus or Dimiaeter come of age.  This happens at age 25 for Aeternus and 18 for Dimiaeter.

The Ad Aetatem consists of three parts - first the child and parents sever ties in a ritualistic ceramony of sacrafice of a small woodland creature and symbolically tying the three together with the intestines of the animal after which an elder cuts them free, severing all bonds.

The second is a drug induced vision quest, upon which the child enters a dream like state and views his what is beleived to a message from the elements.

The third part is a simple tribal tattoo inked to the right temple indicating the clans from which the child hails - one for mother and one for father interjoined.  If during the inking process the child makes a noise, they must wait another year to complete the ritual again.

The Magnus have an additional test added to their Ad Aetatem which tests their skill and power levels as if an instructor had given their assent.  It is no different than prior test.

A dimiaeter also has an additional test added to their Ad Aetatem, this test proves that the child is truly mortal or has gained their immortality of their Aeternus patentage.  It is a simple blood test looking for a specific antibody that prevents the aging process.  But the knowledge is kept close to the Scrin who preform the Ad Aetatem in all forms of the rituals.
