# The Venatori
_(from latin for hunter: venator)_

A group that is an extension of The Aeternus to police and patrol the supernatural creatures.  The Venatori are made up of Aeternus and humans who have been trained to deal with supernatural creatures.  However on occassion other supernatural beings become part of the Venatori.


## Headquarters
The Venatori are a world wide organization, they have five headquarters. 

* New York, New York - This facility is the training ground for all Venator including those with in the Imperordo.  They also monitor the Eastern US and Canada.

* Basilia, Brazil - The Brazilian facility monitors all of South and Central American supernatural creatures.

## Training
Most Venatori are trained from birth to police the supernatural.  It starts out simple, taught by their parents, until they are 13 years old, then they are sent to their special training facility in New York where they are taught how to hunt, kill and/or capture the supernatural elements of the world.  They spend 5 years training before they are let out into the world to do their work.

When an Aeternus or human shows promise, or has befallen a great tragedy at the hands of the supernatural, the Venatori have a choice, they can wipe the memories from the victim, or pull them into the Venatori.  My most Venatori standards it is more harmful to wipe a memory than it is to teach them their way.  But not everyone is cut out to hunt monsters, so mind wiping had become the default practice except for children who's minds are still highly impressionable.

Venatori who are also Magnus are subject to different training and different rules as they are firstly governed by the Imperordo.  However the Venatori and Magnus work together in close proximity training all Magnus in the NYC facility.  The NYC facility being also the headquarters for the Imperordo.  But not all Magnus are Venatori.
