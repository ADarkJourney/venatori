# The Imperordo
_(from latin order and command: ordo, impero)_
The orginzation that rules over all Magnus, defining their heirarchy, rules and oversees the training of all magnus.

The Imperordo is run from New York, New York in the present day.  It migrated to the city that never sleeps during the industrial revolution from it's prior home in London, England.  There are small sanctums in most major cities throughout the world.  The London court still oversees some of the Eurasian training and oversight, but the rules, regulations and the majority of Magnus are trained in New York.

## Heirarchy

A Magnus can be a natural or can be taught when they come of age, this is important in the heirarchy of the Magnus culture.  Nativus (natural) are higher ranked than Eruditus (learned) in most cases.  There is a rare occurance of Eruditus outranking a Nativus magnus because of sheer power and skill, but that is atypical.

There are four elements - Ignis (fire), Aqua (water), Terra (earth), Aeris(air).  A Magnus is clearly defined by his or her element and ability. A fire magnus who was born with the ability to bend the element is called an Nativus Ignis Magnus or NIM.

If a magnus can bend more than one element their primary is listed first (ie:  NITM - fire and earth), and all others follow except for a Cesari, which is just an NC.  There have been no cases of a Cesari who was taught to bend all four elements in recorded history.

There are 5 levels of power.  Typically a magus is at one power level throughout the entire course of their lives, however on a rare occassion with enough training a magus may attain a new level.  

Power, Skill (Novice, Adept, Expert, Master), Elements and Inate ability to bend the elements determing a magnus rank and designation with in the heirarchy of the Imperordo (from latin order and command: ordo, impero).

A natural born Master of the highest power of any one element outranks all others except a Master Cesari.

Each Magnus tends to add the desgination to their names when confiring within the Imperodo.  

For Example a master of the hightest power in fire who was natural born who's name is John Doe would indicate his name as such:  John Doe, MNIM5

A novice third level cesari: NNC3

An expert second level taught magnus in earth and water: EETAeM2

The heirarchy is determined in the following order:  Skill level, Inate ability, Power level.

## Training

A Nativus Magnus typically immerges at a young age - typically around the age of 6 or 7, the earliest recorded was age 3.  The child didn't survive much longer than that as he was unable to understand his ability at that early an age.

Without training a Nativus can destroy ones self with ease, as the powers can tear one's body apart if the control is not found/taught. 

At the age of 10 every Aeternus and Dimieater is tested to see if the can be taught to control the elements.  If they can be taught the choice is given, if a child chooses not to become Magnus, their abilities are pulled from them, leaving them near shells of what they once were, becoming Tacet _(latin for silent)_, most parents encourage their children to learn, being Magnus is a responsiblity but it is also a gift bestowed upon the family.

Every Magnus is designated upon entry to the Imperodo with an ability status of Novice and a power level that is determined in their testing.  For each rank of skill level a new test is preformed, it determins their skill level and their power.  It is rare that power levels increase.  Each skill/level test is preformed at the students instructors request, and not before.

All students must become Adept before they are allowed to take their Ad Aetatem.  If they have come of age but not rerached Adept they remain students until Adept skill level is reached.  There are rare occasions upon which a student never reaches Adept and choose to become Tacet.

While it is rare, some Magnus develope outside of the Imperodo, once these souls are found they are given the same two options as Eruditus - join or becomg Tacet.

### Ad Aetatem

In addition to the nroam Ad Aetatem, a Magus undergoes an additional ritural and their final testing.
