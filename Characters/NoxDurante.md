# Nox Durante, MNC5

## Description:
Nox is 6'0" weighting approximately 180lbs with a hard to maintain athletic build.  He has brown hair with chocolate brown eyes framed with a thick set of eye lashes any woman would die for.  He tends to sport a five o'clock shadow at any time of the day.  Nox almost always has a playful grin plastered on his lips, like everythings a joke to him.  He likes to wear t-shirts with obnoxious sayings, he thinks they are funny and doesn't care if you are offended by them.  Nox's hands with his  long slender fingers are the most defined feature he possess other than his eyes and smile.  Nox's body is host to a few scars he's more than willing to tell you a false tale about how he got them.  (A vampire bite on his right forearm.  Claw marks on his left rib cage from a werebear, a slash across his left cheek from the dagger of a ghost posseed human, burn on his right knee from a dragon's flame) Nox has a tattoo of the four elements in a colored tribal pattern at the back of his neck just below the base of his skull.  The fire symbol is the largest set off to the right side in orange red and yellow flames.  On the left at the top is water in varying shades of blue, below that is wind in shades of grey, and finally below that in shades of green is earth all outlined with a thin black line to enhance the color and contrast.

## Personality:
Nox is loud and it can come off as obnoxious.  He is almost always ready with a joke or a one liner.  He is self-centered, his charm and his attitude tend to get him noticed and he thrives on being center stage.  Nox can make friends where ever he goes, or enemies depending on how they take his infectious attitude.  Nox beleives he is not heroic, but his actions speak louder than his words.  Nox enjoys the company of many human women, most Aeternus or Dimiaeter tend to avoid him because of what he stands for.  Despite the numerous conquests he is alone and the solitude of his job keep him in a state of depression he coveres with his jovial nature.  He has a fear of flying and needles.  Nox is overzealous with his drink on occassion but prefers to act drunk rather than be drunk.

## Biography

### Biographical Facts:

Mother: Leanne Durante (human) (Born 1966 - 48 in 2015)
Father:  Kai Videns, ENIT4 (Aeternus) (Born 1468 - 547 in 2015)

In 2015 Nox turns 22 years old:  Born on Sept 23, 1993
Born in Boulder, Colorado at the Rocky Mountain Venatori Headquarters

Leanne Durante is part of the Venatori, her parents were killed by a rogue werewolf when she was a baby.  The Venatori who found her crying and starving in their cabin in the Colorado woods took her in and raised her as one of her own and taught her the way of the Venatori.

Kai Videns has been part of the Venatori his entire adult life.  He has had many wives, and many female companions, he has 5 pure blood children and 1 Dimiaeter.  Leanne Durante was his female companions in Colorado when he was passing through in 1993 chasing a rogue vampire.  Kai was unaware she became with child, and was one of the rare women to survive the birth of Dimiaeter.  And no one informed him of his child's birth until the boy was 18 when he went through his Ad Aetatem, as both parents are required in attendance unless deceased.

Nox was born into the Venatori, he started training as soon as he could understand, as all Venatori children are taught.  

At the age of 5 Nox started showing signs of being a Magnus like his father, starting random fires - he was designated NNI5 and was started training in the Venatori branch of the Imperordo.  This branch is dedicated to teaching Magnus not only the basics of the Order, but also their lot in the Venatori.  Only Venatori born with the the gift of a magnus ever joins this branch of the Order.

Upon arrival in the NYC Venatori Imperordo training center, Nox was tested in all elements as per the usual.  He was found to be capable of bending all 4 elements  - he was designated NNIAeTA5.

The next 4 years Nox spent his time learning each element bending them individually - fire, air, earth and then water.

His 5th year in the order, he proved to the Order he was cesari by creating a sculputre utilizing all four elements at the same time as an art project for his creativity lessons.  The statue sits in the lobby of the Venatori Imperordo training center.  He was designated NNC5.

At the age of 10, per the usual testing requirements, Skill mastery is tested.  Nox passed into Adept surpassing most his age.  He was designated ANC5

At sixteen while trying to fit in Nox found himself with a bunch of guys getting drunk, daring one another to do stupid things.  They dared Nox to get a tattoo.  Being drunk was the only thing that allowed him to surpass his fear of needles.

His status as Dimiaeter moved his final testing to the age of 18.  One of the youngest Cesari ever recorded.  He went through his Ad Aetatem and was designated MNC5 in addition to the status of immortality added to his credentials.

Nox has been hunting with the Venatori alone for the past 3 years choosing to be alone.  Most of the Aeternus, specifically those in the Venatori see him as an outsider, his birth was rare, his ability is rare, his status as an immortal Dimiaeter as well as his strength all rare, all setting him above nearly all with in the Imperordo and specifically the Venatori Magnus.
