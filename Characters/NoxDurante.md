He likes to wear t-shirts with obnoxious sayings, he thinks they are funny and doesn't care if you are offended by them.  Nox's hands with his  long slender fingers are the most defined feature he possess other than his eyes and smile.  Nox's body is host to a few scars he's more than willing to tell you a false tale about how he got them.  (A vampire bite on his right forearm.  Claw marks on his left rib cage from a werebear, a slash across his left cheek from the dagger of a ghost posseed human, burn on his right knee from a dragon's flame) Nox has a tattoo of the four elements in a colored tribal pattern at the back of his neck just below the base of his skull.  The fire symbol is the largest set off to the right side in orange red and yellow flames.  On the left at the top is water in varying shades of blue, below that is wind in shades of grey, and finally below that in shades of green is earth all outlined with a thin black line to enhance the color and contrast.

Nox is loud and it can come off as obnoxious.  He is almost always ready with a joke or a one liner.  He is self-centered, his charm and his attitude tend to get him noticed and he thrives on being center stage.  Nox can make friends where ever he goes, or enemies depending on how they take his infectious attitude.  Nox beleives he is not heroic, but his actions speak louder than his words.

## Biography

### Biographical Facts:

Mother: Leanne Durante (human) (Born 1966 - 48 in 2015)
Father:  Kai Videns, ENIT4 (Aeternus) (Born 1468 - 547 in 2015)

In 2015 Nox turns 22 years old:  Born on Sept 23, 1993
Born in Boulder, Colorado at the Rocky Mountain Venatori Headquarters

Leanne Durante is part of the Venatori, her parents were killed by a rogue werewolf when she was a baby.  The Venatori who found her crying and starving in their cabin in the Colorado woods took her in and raised her as one of her own and taught her the way of the Venatori.

Kai Videns has been part of the Venatori his entire adult life.  He has had many wives, and many female companions, he has 5 pure blood children and 1 Dimiaeter.  Leanne Durante was his female companions in Colorado when he was passing through in 1993 chasing a rogue vampire.  Kai was unaware she became with child, and was one of the rare women to survive the birth of Dimiaeter.  And no one informed him of his child's birth until the boy was 18 when he went through his Ad Aetatem, as both parents are required in attendance unless deceased.

Nox was born into the Venatori, he started training as soon as he could understand, as all Venatori children are taught.  

At the age of 5 Nox started showing signs of being a Magnus like his father, starting random fires - he was designated NNI5 and was started training in the Venatori branch of the Imperordo.  This branch is dedicated to teaching Magnus not only the basics of the Order, but also their lot in the Venatori.  Only Venatori born with the the gift of a magnus ever joins this branch of the Order.

Upon arrival in the NYC Venatori Imperordo training center, Nox was tested in all elements as per the usual.  He was found to be capable of bending all 4 elements  - he was designated NNIAeTA5.

The next 4 years Nox spent his time learning each element bending them individually - fire, air, earth and then water.

His 5th year in the order, he proved to the Order he was cesari by creating a sculputre utilizing all four elements at the same time as an art project for his creativity lessons.  The statue sits in the lobby of the Venatori Imperordo training center.  He was designated NNC5.

At the age of 10, per the usual testing requirements, Skill mastery is tested.  Nox passed into Adept surpassing most his age.  He was designated ANC5

Nox was quickly becoming an outsider in both the Venatori and the Magnus training programs.  He started seeking human companions outside the facility by sneaking out and gathering the reputation of not following the rules.  He still tried to fit in, but it was a case by case scenario.

At the age of 14 Nox found the company of human women far more pleasing but his dalliances lasted very breifly as he was continuely getting into trouble by his superiors and unable to make anything more happen than a night or two of fun without raising suspicions.

At sixteen while trying to fit in Nox found himself with a bunch of guys getting drunk, daring one another to do stupid things.  They dared Nox to get a tattoo.  Being drunk was the only thing that allowed him to surpass his fear of needles.

Risk taking was one of the few things that kept Nox going as an outsider, he started doing things that were considered dangerous.  His favorite past time was "sky jumping" - vaulting himself from the heights of the buildings with in New York City with only his magic to catch him at the last moment.  By the time his Ad Aetatem came he had a cult following of younger magus strong in air trying to preform the same feats.  Luckily there had been no deaths prior to his graduation.  Afterwards, the practice was forbidden, without Nox's inborn ability to look out for those following him, several boys plummted to their deaths two months after he left New York City.

His status as Dimiaeter moved his final testing to the age of 18.  One of the youngest Cesari ever recorded.  He went through his Ad Aetatem and was designated MNC5 in addition to the status of immortality added to his credentials.

Nox has been hunting with the Venatori alone for the past 3 years choosing to be alone.  Most of the Aeternus, specifically those in the Venatori see him as an outsider, his birth was rare, his ability is rare, his status as an immortal Dimiaeter as well as his strength all rare, all setting him above nearly all with in the Imperordo and specifically the Venatori Magnus.

Nox's first hunt took him to Miami Beach, Florida where his first supernatural creature was of a ghost who had been brutally murdered, at first the vengeful ghost went after only those involved in her murder.  However after her revenge was fullfilled her desire to inflict harm had grown and she started haunting innocents.  She possed a girl before Nox was able to exorcise her from the body, she cut him with her dagger on his left check - leaving a scar.

6 months after his first hunt was successful Nox found himself back in Colorado hunting a werebear - one that had been stronger, and older than most in the region and his talents had been called upon to defeat the creature after it had turned three innocents and killed a dozen others.  In the fight the bear caught him across the ribs on his left before Nox took him out with a fireball that burnt hotter than than any manmade fire could.

A year and 2 months after his turning 18, Nox found himself face to face with a human dragon who was robbing jewelry stores and banks to add to its horde in Hollywood, CA itself - home of everyone's best fantasies.  The dragon never took its real form but unbehest to Nox it could still breathe fire that caught him on his right leg, burning through the cloth and causing third degree burns on his outer leg around his knee.  While he vaquished the dragon by suffocation it had left enough damange that Nox was hold up for three months healing and going through rehab for the burned knee.

A month after he had fully healed and recoperated enough to be let out in the field Nox went after a kiss of vampires.  He managed to take out all but the strongest vampire in a fireball, that one escaped his flames by sheer luck.  It launched itself at Nox and took a bite out of his right forearm before Nox chopped of his head with a sword of fire, earth and air.
