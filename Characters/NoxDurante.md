Father:  Kai Videns, ENIT4 (Aeternus) (Born 1468 - 547 in 2015)

In 2015 Nox turns 22 years old:  Born on Sept 23, 1993

Leanne Durante is part of the Venatori, her parents were killed by a rogue werewolf when she was a baby.  The Venatori who found her crying and starving in their cabin in the Colorado woods took her in and raised her as one of her own and taught her the way of the Venatori.

Kai Videns has been part of the Venatori his entire adult life.  He has had many wives, and many female companions, he has 5 pure blood children and 1 Dimiaeter.  Leanne Durante was his female companions in Colorado when he was passing through in 1993 chasing a rogue vampire.  Kai was unaware she became with child, and was one of the rare women to survive the birth of Dimiaeter.  And no one informed him of his child's birth until the boy was 18 when he went through his Ad Aetatem, as both parents are required in attendance unless deceased.

Nox was born into the Venatori, he started training as soon as he could understand, as all Venatori children are taught.  

At the age of 5 Nox started showing signs of being a Magnus like his father, starting random fires - he was designated NNI5 and was started training in the Venatori branch of the Imperordo.  This branch is dedicated to teaching Magnus not only the basics of the Order, but also their lot in the Venatori.  Only Venatori born with the the gift of a magnus ever joins this branch of the Order.

Upon arrival in the NYC Venatori Imperordo training center, Nox was tested in all elements as per the usual.  He was found to be capable of bending all 4 elements.  - he was designated NNIAeTA5.

The next 4 years Nox spent his time learning each element bending them individually - fire, air, earth and then water.

His 5th year in the order, he proved to the Order he was cesari by creating a sculputre utilizing all four elements at the same time as an art project for his creativity lessons.  The statue sits in the lobby of the Venatori Imperordo training center.  He was designated NNC5.

At the age of 10, per the usual testing requirements, Skill mastery is tested.  Nox passed into Adept surpassing most his age.  He was designated ANC5

His status as Dimiaeter moved his final testing to the age of 18.  One of the youngest Cesari ever recorded.  He went through his Ad Aetatem and was designated MNC5 in addition to the status of immortality added to his credentials.

Nox has been hunting with the Venatori alone for the past 3 years choosing to be alone.  Most of the Aeternus, specifically those in the Venatori see him as an outsider, his birth was rare, his ability is rare, his status as an immortal Dimiaeter as well as his strength all rare, all setting him above nearly all with in the Imperordo and specifically the Venatori Magnus.
