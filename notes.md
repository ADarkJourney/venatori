# The Aeternus
_(from latin for etnernal: aeternus)_
A race of immortal beings - or seemingly so - they do not age, nor do they die from sickness or disease - but they can be killed.  They are the overlords to most of the worlds supernatural beings.  Because of their long life Aeternus control their population - one full blooded child per couple per 100 years.

An Aeternus stops aging upon completely the Ad Aetatem (coming of age) ritual, which is usually held around a quarter of a century old.

# Dimiaeter
_(from latin for half and eternal: dimidius)_
Dimiaeter are half Aeternus and half human.  They are a rare speices as most female Aeternus do not fraternize with male humans.  Under most circumstances  female human is unable to carry a dimiaeter to full term, but it has been known to happen on a VERY rare occassion.  Dimiaeter are not usually immortal, they have longer than human lives

Dimiaeter living with Aeternus preform the Ad Aetatem, this is typically the indicator as to their immortal or their extended life cycle.  Approximately one in every 1000 Dimiaeter are immortal.  The ritural is preformed at the age of 18 for all Dimiaeter.

# The Venatori 
_(from latin for hunter: venator)_
A group that is an extension of The Aeternus to police and patrol the supernatural creatures.  The Venatori are made up of  Aeternus and humans who have been trained to deal with supernatural creatures.  However on occassion other supernatural beings become part of the Venatori.

# Scrin
_(from latin for achivist: Scriniarii)_
An Aeternus who's sole existance is to record history.  Each Scrin typically devotes their life to a very small niche of history.  Very few Scrin focus on more than that one little niche.

# Magnus
_(from latin for mage: Magnus)_
A Magnus is typically an Aeternus or Dimiaeter who can bend the elements to their will.  Most Magnus can only easily manipulate one elemental force, the others remaining just out of reach, however there are a handful who can do more than one, and typically they can only bend one element at a time.  A magnus who can bend all four elements at once is called a cesari.

## Heirarchy

A Magnus can be a natural or can be taught when they come of age, this is important in the heirarchy of the Magnus culture.  Nativus (natural) are higher ranked than Eruditus (learned) in most cases.  There is a rare occurance of Eruditus outranking a Nativus magnus because of sheer power and skill, but that is atypical.

There are four elements - Ignis (fire), Aqua (water), Terra (earth), Aeris(air).  A Magnus is clearly defined by his or her element and ability. A fire magnus who was born with the ability to bend the element is called an Nativus Ignis Magnus or NIM.

If a magnus can bend more than one element their primary is listed first (ie:  NITM - fire and earth), and all others follow except for a Cesari, which is just an NC.  There have been no cases of a Cesari who was taught to bend all four elements in recorded history.

There are 5 levels of power.  Typically a magus is at one power level throughout the entire course of their lives, however on a rare occassion with enough training a magus may attain a new level.  

Power, Skill (Novice, Adept, Expert, Master), Elements and Inate ability to bend the elements determing a magnus rank and designation with in the heirarchy of the Imperordo (from latin order and command: ordo, impero).

A natural born Master of the highest power of any one element outranks all others except a Master Cesari.

Each Magnus tends to add the desgination to their names when confiring within the Imperodo.  

For Example a master of the hightest power in fire who was natural born who's name is John Doe would indicate his name as such:  John Doe, MNIM5

A novice third level cesari: NNC3

An expert second level taught magnus in earth and water: EETAeM2

The heirarchy is determined in the following order:  Skill level, Inate ability, Power level.

## Cesari 
_(from latin for alchemist: Cesarem)_
A Magnus with the ability to bend all four elements at the same time.

## The Imperordo
_(from latin order and command: ordo, impero)_
The orginzation that rules over all Magnus, defining their heirarchy, rules and oversees the training of all magnus.
